In the key of C, the lines and spaces on the staff represent white keys on the piano.  This represents a sequence of half and whole steps:  WWHWWWH. To figure out sharps and flats on other keys, just start on that key and do the same sequence of half and whole steps as in C.  For example key of G is GABCDEF# and the key of F is FGABbCDE
